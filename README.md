# Weather-app-React.js

I just created a sleek and minimalist weather application using React, designed to effortlessly showcase the current weather conditions of any city worldwide through the OpenWeather API. This application provides real-time updates on temperature, "feels like" temperature, wind speed, humidity, and dynamically adjusts its weather icon to reflect the current weather conditions, whether it's raining, cloudy, sunny, or otherwise.
